I created a working quiz test your knowledge on JavaScript.
When the start button is click timer starts and the questions will
appear, when answered incorrectly 10 seconds with be deducted on
the timer on the upper right hand corner, at the end you will be prompted
to enter your initials and after submitting your initials and score data
will be saved onto the local storage.

Some codes I used were pulled off W3schools and developer.mozilla.org
example
location.href=""; - used to navigate to another page


Some of the codes were still a little confusing so I looked at a couple
of examples on stackoverflow.com about storing on localStorage and
get the info you needed out of it
